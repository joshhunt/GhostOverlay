    /// When an inventory item (DestinyInventoryItemDefinition) has Stats (such as Attack Power), the item will refer to a Stat Group. This definition enumerates the properties used to transform the item&#39;s \&quot;Investment\&quot; stats into \&quot;Display\&quot; stats.  See DestinyStatDefinition&#39;s documentation for information about the transformation of Stats, and the meaning of an Investment vs. a Display stat.  If you don&#39;t want to do these calculations on your own, fear not: pulling live data from the BNet endpoints will return display stat values pre-computed and ready for you to use. I highly recommend this approach, saves a lot of time and also accounts for certain stat modifiers that can&#39;t easily be accounted for without live data (such as stat modifiers on Talent Grids and Socket Plugs)
