    /// This definition represents an \&quot;Activity Mode\&quot; as it exists in the Historical Stats endpoints. An individual Activity Mode represents a collection of activities that are played in a certain way. For example, Nightfall Strikes are part of a \&quot;Nightfall\&quot; activity mode, and any activities played as the PVP mode \&quot;Clash\&quot; are part of the \&quot;Clash activity mode.  Activity modes are nested under each other in a hierarchy, so that if you ask for - for example - \&quot;AllPvP\&quot;, you will get any PVP activities that the user has played, regardless of what specific PVP mode was being played.
