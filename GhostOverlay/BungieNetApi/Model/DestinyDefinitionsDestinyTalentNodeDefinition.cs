These nodes have positions in the talent grid&#39;s UI, and contain \&quot;Steps\&quot; (DestinyTalentNodeStepDefinition), one of whom will be the \&quot;Current\&quot; step.  The Current Step determines the visual properties of the node, as well as what the node grants when it is activated.  See DestinyTalentGridDefinition for a more complete overview of how Talent Grids work, and how they are used in Destiny 2 (and how they were used in Destiny 1).
